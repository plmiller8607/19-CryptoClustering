# CryptoClustering
# Overview 
The purpose of this challenge is to utilize Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. The value for K-Means was determine by using both scaled and PCA dataframes and the results were compared.

# Resources 
• Jupyter notebook starter code
• csv file

# Usage 
•   Scale the dataframe & find the best value for k
•   Cluster the crytocurrencies with K_Means using the scaled dataframe
•   Create a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) & find the best value for k
•   Cluster the crytocurrencies with K_Means using the PCA dataframe
•   Visualize & compare results

# Dependencies
• Pandas
• hvPlot
• SKLearn
• K-Means
• PCA
• StandardScaler
